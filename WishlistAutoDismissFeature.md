# Wishlist Auto-Dismiss Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented auto-dismiss functionality for the wishlist success handler in `SearchResultDetailView.swift`. When a user adds a book to their wishlist, the view now automatically dismisses after showing a success toast, providing a smoother user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-Dismiss Logic (âœ… Completed)
**Location**: `SearchResultDetailView.swift`, lines 240-252

**Implementation**:
- When a book is added to the wishlist, the success toast appears immediately with a spring animation
- After 1.5 seconds, the toast begins fading out (0.3 second animation)
- 0.2 seconds after the fade begins, the view automatically dismisses
- Total time from button press to dismiss: approximately 2 seconds

**Code**:
```swift
if toWishlist {
    HapticFeedbackManager.shared.lightImpact()
    successMessage = "ðŸ“š Added to your wishlist! Returning to search..."
    
    withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.6, dampingFraction: 0.8)) {
        showingSuccessToast = true
    }
    
    // Show toast for 1.5 seconds, then fade out and dismiss
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.5) {
        // Start fading out the toast
        withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) {
            showingSuccessToast = false
        }
        
        // After toast starts fading, wait briefly then dismiss the view
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
            dismiss()
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Success Message (âœ… Completed)
**Location**: `SearchResultDetailView.swift`, line 242

**Change**:
- Old message: "ðŸ“š Added to your wishlist!"
- New message: "ðŸ“š Added to your wishlist! Returning to search..."

This gives users a clear indication that the view will dismiss automatically.

### 3. Adjusted Timing Sequence (âœ… Completed)
**Implementation**:
1. Success toast appears immediately with spring animation
2. Toast remains visible for 1.5 seconds
3. Toast fades out over 0.3 seconds
4. View dismisses 0.2 seconds after fade begins
5. Total experience: smooth, non-jarring transition

### 4. Done Button Logic Update (âœ… Completed)
**Location**: `SearchResultDetailView.swift`, lines 172-180

**Implementation**:
- The "Done" button in the toolbar now only appears for library additions
- It does not appear for wishlist additions since the view auto-dismisses
- Uses proper operator precedence: `!(newlyAddedBook?.onWishlist ?? false)`

**Code**:
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
        // Done button only appears for library additions (not wishlist)
        // since wishlist auto-dismisses
        Button("Done") {
            dismiss()
        }
        .opacity(showingSuccessToast && !(newlyAddedBook?.onWishlist ?? false) ? 1.0 : 0.0)
        .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3), value: showingSuccessToast)
    }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Add to wishlist â†’ success toast appears â†’ view auto-dismisses after ~2 seconds
- [ ] Add to library â†’ success toast appears â†’ edit view opens (no auto-dismiss)
- [ ] Verify haptic feedback works correctly for both flows
- [ ] Check that the "Done" button only appears for library additions
- [ ] Ensure navigation back button remains functional throughout

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Animations are smooth and non-jarring
- [ ] Timing feels natural (not too fast, not too slow)
- [ ] Success message clearly indicates auto-dismiss behavior
- [ ] Toast fade-out animation completes before dismiss
- [ ] No visual glitches during the transition

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Auto-dismiss respects reduced motion settings
- [ ] VoiceOver announces the success message properly
- [ ] Sufficient time is given for users to read the success message
- [ ] No interference with other accessibility features

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Rapid button tapping doesn't cause issues
- [ ] Dismiss doesn't interfere with edit sheet presentation
- [ ] Works correctly when book already exists (duplicate detection)
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully

## Build Status
âœ… **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All changes compile without errors

## Notes
- The library flow remains unchanged: shows success toast, then opens the edit view for customization
- The wishlist flow is now streamlined: shows success toast with auto-dismiss
- Haptic feedback remains consistent across both flows
- The implementation respects accessibility settings for animations
