# Data Source Tracking Enhancement Project

## Project Overview

Enhance the books app to track data sources (Google Books API, CSV import, manual entry) and build user engagement features that prompt users to complete and enhance their library data.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Tracking (Limited)
- ✅ BookMetadata.googleBooksID indicates API vs CSV origin
- ✅ CSV-only books get unique `"csv_UUID"` identifiers
- ✅ Import process logs distinguish API vs CSV fallbacks
- ❌ No field-level data source tracking
- ❌ No user engagement prompts based on data completeness
- ❌ No data quality/confidence scoring

## Phase 1: Core Data Source Infrastructure

### 1.1 Enhance Data Models

**BookMetadata.swift Additions:**
```swift
// Primary data source for the entire book record
var dataSource: DataSource = .manual

// Field-level tracking for mixed-source books
var fieldDataSources: [String: DataSourceInfo] = [:]

// Overall data quality metrics
var dataCompleteness: Double = 0.0 // 0.0-1.0
var lastDataUpdate: Date = Date()
var dataQualityScore: Double = 1.0 // Existing field enhanced
```

**UserBook.swift Additions:**
```swift
// User engagement tracking
var needsUserInput: [UserInputPrompt] = []
var userDataCompleteness: Double = 0.0 // Personal data completeness
var lastUserReview: Date?
var userEngagementScore: Double = 0.0 // How actively user maintains this book

// Data source awareness for user fields
var personalDataSources: [String: DataSourceInfo] = [:]
```

**New Supporting Types:**
```swift
enum DataSource: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
    case googleBooksAPI = "google_books_api"
    case csvImport = "csv_import"
    case manualEntry = "manual_entry"
    case mixedSources = "mixed_sources"
    case userInput = "user_input"
}

struct DataSourceInfo: Codable, Sendable {
    let source: DataSource
    let timestamp: Date
    let confidence: Double // 0.0-1.0 (API=1.0, CSV=0.7, manual=0.9)
    let fieldPath: String? // e.g., "title", "authors[0]", "userRating"
}

enum UserInputPrompt: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
    case addPersonalRating = "add_personal_rating"
    case addPersonalNotes = "add_personal_notes"
    case reviewCulturalData = "review_cultural_data"
    case validateImportedData = "validate_imported_data"
    case addTags = "add_tags"
    case updateReadingProgress = "update_reading_progress"
    case confirmBookDetails = "confirm_book_details"
}
```

### 1.2 Migration Strategy

**SwiftData Migration:**
- Add new fields with default values
- Backfill existing data with appropriate sources:
  - Books with googleBooksID starting with "csv_" → `.csvImport`
  - Books with valid googleBooksID → `.googleBooksAPI`
  - All others → `.manualEntry`
- Calculate initial completeness scores

### 1.3 Enhanced Import Services

**CSVImportService.swift Updates:**
- Track which fields come from CSV vs API lookup
- Set confidence scores based on data validation results
- Generate initial UserInputPrompt suggestions
- Update dataSource and fieldDataSources appropriately

**BookSearchService.swift Updates:**
- Mark API-fetched fields with high confidence
- Track timestamp and source for each field
- Implement field-level merge strategies for mixed sources

## Phase 2: Data Quality & Completeness Engine

### 2.1 Data Completeness Calculator

**New Service: DataCompletenessService.swift**
```swift
@MainActor
class DataCompletenessService {
    // Calculate overall book data completeness
    static func calculateBookCompleteness(_ book: UserBook) -> Double
    
    // Calculate metadata completeness 
    static func calculateMetadataCompleteness(_ metadata: BookMetadata) -> Double
    
    // Calculate user-specific completeness
    static func calculateUserCompleteness(_ book: UserBook) -> Double
    
    // Generate smart user prompts based on data gaps
    static func generateUserPrompts(_ book: UserBook) -> [UserInputPrompt]
    
    // Analyze data quality across entire library
    static func analyzeLibraryQuality(_ books: [UserBook]) -> LibraryQualityReport
}
```

### 2.2 Smart Prompt Generation

**Logic for generating user prompts:**
- Books from CSV import without ratings → `addPersonalRating`
- API books without personal notes → `addPersonalNotes`
- Books missing cultural metadata → `reviewCulturalData`
- Low-confidence imported data → `validateImportedData`
- Books without tags → `addTags`
- Reading books without recent progress → `updateReadingProgress`

### 2.3 Data Quality Scoring

**Enhanced scoring system:**
- API data: confidence = 1.0
- CSV data with validation: confidence = 0.8
- CSV data without validation: confidence = 0.6
- Manual entry: confidence = 0.9
- User-reviewed data: confidence = 1.0

## Phase 3: User Engagement Features

### 3.1 Library Enhancement Dashboard

**New View: LibraryEnhancementView.swift**
- Data completeness overview
- Smart suggestions for library improvement
- Quick actions for common enhancements
- Progress tracking for library quality

**Key Metrics Displayed:**
- Overall library completeness: X%
- Books needing attention: N books
- Data source breakdown (API/CSV/Manual)

### 3.2 Smart Prompts System

**New Component: SmartPromptCard.swift**
- Context-aware prompts based on data sources
- One-tap actions for common enhancements
- Dismissible with "remind me later" option
- Progress celebration when goals reached

**Integration Points:**
