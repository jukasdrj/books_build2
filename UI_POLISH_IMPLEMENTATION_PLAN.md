# Two-Phase Data Quality UI Polish Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis
✅ **Backend Complete**: DataCompletenessService fully implemented with smart prompt generation
✅ **Dashboard Exists**: LibraryEnhancementView created but not integrated into main navigation  
❌ **Missing Integration**: Smart prompts not displayed in book details or library views
❌ **Confusing Duplication**: Two different enhancement views (LibraryEnhancementView vs LibraryEnrichmentView)

## Phase 1: UI Integration & Polish (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Navigation Integration

```swift
// LibraryView.swift:83 - INCORRECT
.sheet(isPresented: $showingEnhancement) {
    LibraryEnrichmentView(modelContext: modelContext)  // Wrong view!
}
```

**Should be:**
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingEnhancement) {
    LibraryEnhancementView()  // Correct data quality dashboard
}
```
