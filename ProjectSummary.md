## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

-   **UI**: SwiftUI with NavigationStack-based architecture
-   **Data**: SwiftData with `UserBook` and `BookMetadata` models
-   **Navigation**: Robust 4-tab `TabView` in `ContentView.swift` (Library, Wishlist, Search, Stats) with programmatic tab switching
-   **API Integration**: `BookSearchService.swift` handles Google Books API calls with async/await pattern
-   **Theming**: A centralized theme system in `Theme.swift` and `Color+Extensions.swift` provides Material Design 3 colors, typography, and spacing
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses `async/await` for network requests and image loading
-   **Caching**: `ImageCache.swift` provides an in-memory cache for book cover images
-   **Navigation Architecture**: Modern NavigationStack with value-based NavigationLink and stable Hashable model conformance

## üí° Key Development Patterns

### Navigation Architecture
-   **NavigationStack Consistency**: All views use NavigationStack (iOS 16+) for consistent navigation behavior
-   **Value-Based Navigation**: NavigationLink(value:) with proper Hashable model conformance for stable destinations
-   **Programmatic Tab Switching**: Empty states switch to appropriate tabs via selectedTab binding instead of nested navigation
-   **No Mixed Navigation Systems**: Eliminated NavigationView usage to prevent conflicts with NavigationStack

### Data & State Management
-   **SwiftData Navigation Compatibility**: Navigation destination views use modelContext.fetch() instead of @Query to prevent update conflicts
-   **Hashable Models**: BookMetadata implements Hashable using unique googleBooksID for stable navigation identity
-   **Proper State Binding**: selectedTab binding propagated to child views for programmatic navigation control

### UI & Theming
-   **Theming**: Access theme properties via static `Theme` properties (e.g., `Theme.Color.PrimaryAction`, `Theme.Typography.bodyLarge`)
-   **Color System**: Use `Color.theme.*` for adaptive dark/light mode colors defined programmatically in `Color+Extensions.swift`
-   **Array Storage in SwiftData**: Arrays of strings (like authors, genres) are stored as a single `String` separated by `|||` and accessed via a computed property
-   **Loading States**: Use the `ShimmerModifier` and `EnhancedLoadingView` for professional, animated loading states
-   **User Feedback**: Provide haptic feedback and use the `SuccessToast` view for non-intrusive success messages

### Architecture Principles
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between Models, Views, Services, and Utilities
-   **Modular Design**: Components organized in logical directories for scalability
-   **Modern SwiftUI Patterns**: Uses latest SwiftUI navigation, async/await, and SwiftData best practices
-   **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback
-   **Performance Optimized**: Efficient navigation, caching, and state management patterns

## üîß Recent Architectural Improvements

### Navigation System Overhaul ‚úÖ
-   **Fixed SearchResultDetailView Navigation**: Resolved critical issue where search result detail views would briefly appear then dismiss
-   **Eliminated Navigation Conflicts**: Removed NavigationView/NavigationStack mixing that caused navigation instability
-   **Proper Empty State Flow**: Fixed nested navigation contexts from empty wishlist "Browse Books" action
-   **Stable Navigation Destinations**: Added Hashable conformance to BookMetadata for reliable navigation

### SwiftData Integration Improvements ‚úÖ
-   **Navigation Destination Compatibility**: Replaced problematic @Query usage in navigation destinations with direct fetching
-   **Transaction Safety**: All SwiftData operations properly scoped to avoid write transaction conflicts
-   **Model Relationships**: Robust one-to-many relationship between BookMetadata and UserBook

### User Experience Enhancements ‚úÖ
-   **Comprehensive Haptic Feedback**: Tactile confirmation throughout the app
-   **Professional Loading States**: Engaging animations with proper state management
-   **Success Confirmation Flow**: Elegant toast notifications with auto-dismiss functionality
