## üí° Key Development Patterns

### Material Design 3 Component System ‚úÖ **NEW**
-   **Material Cards**: All card-like components use `.materialCard()` with proper elevation, shadows, and adaptive colors
-   **Material Buttons**: Comprehensive `.materialButton()` system with MaterialButtonStyle (.filled, .tonal, .outlined, .text, .destructive, .success) and MaterialButtonSize (.small, .medium, .large)
-   **Material Interactive**: Enhanced `.materialInteractive()` with MaterialInteractiveModifier providing configurable press feedback, scale effects, and accessibility-aware animations
-   **Theme Spacing**: All spacing uses `Theme.Spacing` constants following 8pt grid system for consistent layout relationships

### Navigation Architecture
-   **NavigationStack Consistency**: All views use NavigationStack (iOS 16+) for consistent navigation behavior
-   **Value-Based Navigation**: NavigationLink(value:) with proper Hashable model conformance for stable destinations
-   **Auto-Navigation Workflows**: Intelligent routing where library additions auto-navigate to EditBookView for immediate customization, while wishlist additions show success feedback only
-   **Programmatic Tab Switching**: Empty states switch to appropriate tabs via selectedTab binding instead of nested navigation
-   **No Mixed Navigation Systems**: Eliminated NavigationView usage to prevent conflicts with NavigationStack

### Data & State Management
-   **SwiftData Navigation Compatibility**: Navigation destination views use modelContext.fetch() instead of @Query to prevent update conflicts
-   **Hashable Models**: BookMetadata implements Hashable using unique googleBooksID for stable navigation identity
-   **Proper State Binding**: selectedTab binding propagated to child views for programmatic navigation control
-   **Reading Progress Integration**: UserBook model includes comprehensive progress tracking with currentPage, readingProgress, ReadingSession analytics, and pace calculations

### UI & Theming
-   **Material Design 3 Theming**: Access theme properties via static `Theme` properties with full Material Design 3 component support
-   **Adaptive Color System**: Use `Color.theme.*` for adaptive dark/light mode colors with comprehensive Material Design 3 color tokens
-   **Consistent Spacing System**: All layouts use `Theme.Spacing` constants (.xs, .sm, .md, .lg, .xl, .xxl) following 8pt grid system
-   **Typography Tokens**: Material Design 3 typography with proper view modifiers (.titleMedium(), .bodyLarge(), .labelSmall(), etc.)
-   **Array Storage in SwiftData**: Arrays of strings (like authors, genres) are stored as a single `String` separated by `|||` and accessed via a computed property
-   **Loading States**: Use the `ShimmerModifier` and `EnhancedLoadingView` for professional, animated loading states
-   **User Feedback**: Provide haptic feedback and use the `SuccessToast` view for non-intrusive success messages

### Architecture Principles
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between Models, Views, Services, and Utilities
-   **Modular Design**: Components organized in logical directories for scalability
-   **Modern SwiftUI Patterns**: Uses latest SwiftUI navigation, async/await, and SwiftData best practices
-   **Material Design 3 Compliance**: Full adherence to Material Design 3 guidelines with consistent component usage
-   **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback
-   **Performance Optimized**: Efficient navigation, caching, and state management patterns
