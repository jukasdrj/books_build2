# Compiler Type-Checking Fix - CSVImportView

## Problem
The SwiftUI compiler reported: "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time" at line 262 in `CSVImportView.swift`

## Root Cause
The `ImportProgressView` had a complex view hierarchy with multiple nested conditionals, computations, and view builders all in a single `body` property. This made it difficult for the Swift compiler to infer types efficiently.

## Solution Applied
Refactored the `ImportProgressView` to break down the complex view into smaller, manageable sub-views:

### 1. **Extracted Main Components**
- `progressContent`: Main progress visualization container
- `cancelButton`: Standalone cancel button

### 2. **Created Helper View Builders**
- `progressCircle`: The circular progress indicator
- `percentageText()`: Progress percentage display
- `progressCountText()`: Book count display
- `progressDetails()`: Detailed progress information
- `timeRemainingText()`: Estimated time display
- `progressStats()`: Import statistics summary

### 3. **Benefits of Refactoring**
- **Improved Compilation**: Each sub-view is type-checked independently
- **Better Readability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier Maintenance**: Each component can be modified independently
- **Performance**: Compiler can optimize smaller view builders more efficiently

## Technical Details

### Before (Complex Single View):
```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: Theme.Spacing.xl) {
        // 100+ lines of nested views, conditionals, and computations
        // All in a single expression
    }
}
```

### After (Modular Sub-views):
```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: Theme.Spacing.xl) {
        Spacer()
        progressContent      // Extracted sub-view
        Spacer()
        cancelButton        // Extracted sub-view
    }
    .padding(Theme.Spacing.lg)
    .accessibilityElement(children: .combine)
    .accessibilityLabel("Import in progress")
    .accessibilityValue(importService.importProgress?.progress.formatted(.percent) ?? "Unknown progress")
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No compiler warnings
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ UI remains identical

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Break down complex views** into smaller, focused components
2. **Use @ViewBuilder** for conditional view logic
3. **Extract repeated UI patterns** into separate functions
4. **Keep view body properties simple** and delegate complexity to sub-views

This refactoring pattern can be applied to other complex views in the project if similar compiler issues arise.
