## üìÅ File Organization Principles

### **Naming Conventions**
- **Views**: Descriptive names ending with "View" (e.g., LibraryView.swift)
- **Models**: Noun-based names describing data entities (e.g., BookMetadata.swift)
- **Services**: Action-based names ending with "Service" (e.g., BookSearchService.swift)
- **Components**: Descriptive component names (e.g., BookCardView.swift)

### **Directory Structure Logic**
- **Flat structure** in main /books/ directory for core views and components
- **Specialized subdirectories** for related functionality (Models/, Charts/, Markdown/)
- **Test separation** with dedicated test directories
- **Documentation** at root level for easy access

### **Dependency Management**
- **Internal dependencies**: Views depend on models, services, and theme system
- **External dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies (SwiftUI, SwiftData, Charts)
- **Service layer**: Clean separation between UI and data/API layers

### **Code Organization Best Practices**
- **Single responsibility**: Each file has a clear, focused purpose
- **Modular design**: Reusable components and services
- **Theme consistency**: Centralized theme system used throughout
- **Accessibility first**: Comprehensive accessibility support in all views
- **Error handling**: Consistent error handling patterns across the app
- **Loading states**: Professional loading animations and user feedback throughout
