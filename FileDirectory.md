# File Directory

## Root Structure

The Books Reading Tracker project is organized into several main directories with comprehensive documentation and modular architecture supporting cultural diversity tracking and reading analytics.

## üìö Documentation Files (Root Level)

### **ProjectSummary.md**
- **Purpose**: A consolidated summary of the project. It contains the project's core concept, architecture, key files, and development patterns. This is the primary source for quick context.

### **Documentation.md, Roadmap.md, Accomplished.md**
- **Purpose**: These files have been consolidated into `ProjectSummary.md` and are now ignored by git. They are kept for historical reference but are no longer the primary source of truth.

### **FileDirectory.md**
- **Purpose**: This file - complete directory structure documentation.
- **Contains**: Detailed description of each file's responsibility and architectural relationships.
- **Usage**: Navigate codebase efficiently and understand file organization.

### **TODO.md**
- **Purpose**: Current development priorities and task tracking.
- **Contains**: Active tasks, completed items, and immediate development focus areas.
- **Usage**: Guide current development session priorities and track completion status.

### **alex.md**
- **Purpose**: AI assistant memory and project-specific notes.
- **Contains**: Learning notes, user preferences, and development patterns.
- **Usage**: Maintain AI assistant context across sessions.

## üìÅ File Organization Principles

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear separation between Views (Main/Detail/Components), Models, Services, Utilities, Theme, and Extensions.
- **Modular Design**: Each directory serves a specific architectural purpose.
- **Scalability**: Structure supports easy addition of new features and components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic, UI components, data models, and utilities are clearly separated.
- **Navigation Patterns**: Uses modern SwiftUI navigation with NavigationStack and value-based NavigationLink.
