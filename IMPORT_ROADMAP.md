- **Components**:
  - Save current mapping as template
  - Quick-apply saved templates for similar CSV formats
  - Community template sharing (future)

- **Capabilities**:
  - Edit book metadata directly from CSV data
  - Search and select from multiple API results
  - Add custom book covers
  - Merge duplicate detection with manual override
- **Integration**: Accessible from error log and review modal

#### 3.2 Enhanced Import Preview
- **Feature**: More detailed pre-import analysis
- **Enhancements**:
  - Data quality scoring with specific recommendations
  - Estimated success rates based on data completeness
  - Column mapping validation with warnings
  - Duplicate prediction before import starts
- **Smart Suggestions**: Auto-fix common CSV data issues

#### 3.3 Import Error Export & Analysis
- **Feature**: Export detailed error reports for external analysis
- **Formats**: 
  - CSV with full error details and suggestions
  - PDF report with import summary and troubleshooting guide
  - JSON for developer analysis
- **Content**:
  - Per-book error details with original CSV data
  - Recommended fixes for each error type
  - Import session metadata and performance stats

### Phase 4: Advanced User Experience üé®
**Priority: Low | Timeline: 6-10 weeks**

#### 4.1 Import Progress Enhancements
- **Features**:
  - Live Activity improvements with book titles
  - Progress indicators showing specific books being processed
  - Estimated time remaining with dynamic updates
  - Pausable imports with resume capability

#### 4.2 Smart Import Assistance
- **AI-Powered Features**:
  - Automatic CSV format detection
  - Smart column mapping suggestions
  - Intelligent duplicate resolution
  - Auto-correction of common data entry errors
- **Machine Learning**: Learn from user corrections to improve future imports

#### 4.3 Collaborative Import Features
- **Community Features**:
  - Share CSV templates with other users
  - Crowdsourced book metadata corrections
  - Import success rate sharing (anonymous)
  - Community troubleshooting guides

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Architecture Changes
- New `ImportSession` SwiftData model for history
- Enhanced `ImportError` model with more metadata
- Retry tracking in existing `ImportProgress` model
- Template storage for column mappings

### UI Architecture
- New navigation section: Settings ‚Üí Import Management
- Enhanced error modal with actionable buttons
- Dedicated import history and diagnostics screens
- Integration with existing background import system

### Performance Considerations
- Limit import history retention (configurable, default 6 months)
- Implement efficient error log pagination
- Background cleanup of old import data
- Memory-efficient large CSV preview

## Success Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduced support queries about "failed imports"
- **Import Success Rate**: Target 95%+ overall success rate
- **User Retention**: Increased usage of import feature
- **Error Resolution**: 80%+ of failed books successfully retried

## Future Considerations
- Integration with cloud storage services (iCloud, Google Drive)
- Batch import from multiple CSV files
- API integrations with library management systems
- Advanced book matching algorithms using ML
