```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Live Activity Data Flow
1. **Start**: `BackgroundImportCoordinator.startBackgroundImport()` calls `LiveActivityManager.startImportActivity()`
2. **Progress**: `monitorImportProgress()` calls `LiveActivityManager.updateActivity()` every 2 seconds
3. **Completion**: `handleImportCompletion()` calls `LiveActivityManager.completeImportActivity()`
4. **Cancellation**: `cancelImport()` calls `LiveActivityManager.endCurrentActivity()`

### Data Structure
```swift
CSVImportActivityAttributes.ContentState:
- progress: Double                    // 0.0 to 1.0
- currentStep: String                 // Descriptive progress message
- booksProcessed: Int                 // Books completed
- totalBooks: Int                     // Total books to process
- successCount: Int                   // Successfully imported
- duplicateCount: Int                 // Duplicates skipped
- failureCount: Int                   // Failed imports
- currentBookTitle: String?           // Currently processing book
- currentBookAuthor: String?          // Currently processing author
```

### Visual Components

#### Dynamic Island Layouts:
- **Compact**: Progress ring + book count
- **Expanded**: Detailed progress + statistics + current book
- **Minimal**: Simple progress indicator

#### Lock Screen Widget:
- File name header with progress percentage
- Linear progress bar with custom styling
- Current step description
- Statistics badges (success/duplicate/failure)
- Current book information section
- Gradient background with shadows

## üéØ User Experience Features
