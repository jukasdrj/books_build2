- [x] **Form UX Enhancement**: Replaced .disabled(true) fields with .textSelection(.enabled) and proper accessibility hints
- [x] **Minimum Hit Areas**: Added 44pt minimum heights and .contentShape(Rectangle()) for interactive elements  
- [x] **VoiceOver Labels**: Enhanced accessibility with comprehensive labels, hints, and identifiers throughout

### ‚úÖ PHASE 2: Interaction & Motion Polish
- [x] **Reduce Motion Respect**: All animations now check UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled
- [x] **Haptic Optimization**: All haptics gated with UIAccessibility.isVoiceOverRunning checks
- [x] **Navigation Polish**: Removed inappropriate tab bar hiding, enhanced navigation flow consistency
- [x] **Enhanced Loading States**: Made all loading animations accessibility-aware

### ‚úÖ PHASE 3: Security & Testing Polish

- [x] **Modern UI Testing**: Updated to use XCUIDevice.shared.userInterfaceStyle instead of SpringBoard manipulation
- [x] **Accessibility Identifiers**: Added stable identifiers like "SearchResultRow_\(book.googleBooksID)" for testing

### ‚úÖ BONUS: Additional Achievements
- [x] **Directory Reorganization**: Complete project structure reorganization following iOS best practices
- [x] **Status Label Updates**: Changed to book community abbreviations (TBR, DNF)
- [x] **Migration Issue Resolution**: Fixed SwiftData decoding errors and data model inconsistencies
- [x] **Technical Debt Cleanup**: Resolved SF Symbol errors and documentation synchronization
- [x] **Data Model Specification**: Updated documentation v0.2 ‚Üí v1.0 to match evolved codebase
