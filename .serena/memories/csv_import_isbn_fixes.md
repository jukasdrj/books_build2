# CSV Import ISBN Fixes - 2025-08-10

## Issue Identified
CSV imports from Goodreads were failing due to leading `=` characters in ISBN fields (e.g., `=9780142437209` instead of `9780142437209`).

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Excel/Goodreads Export**: Goodreads CSV exports include leading `=` to prevent Excel from reformatting ISBN numbers
2. **Missing Sanitization**: ISBN cleaning logic only removed hyphens and spaces, not `=` characters
3. **API Failure**: Google Books API rejected malformed ISBNs like `isbn:=9780142437209`

## Files Modified
### CSVImportService.swift
- **Line 546-548**: Added `.replacingOccurrences(of: "=", with: "")` to ISBN cleaning
- **Line 416-418**: Applied same fix to duplicate detection logic

### BookSearchService.swift  
- **Line 155-158**: Added `=` removal in ISBN prefix handling
- **Line 163**: Added `=` removal in general ISBN detection
- **Line 196**: Added `=` removal in `isISBN()` validation method

## Technical Implementation
```swift
// Before (broken)
let cleanISBN = isbn.replacingOccurrences(of: "-", with: "")
                   .replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
                   .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)

// After (fixed)
let cleanISBN = isbn.replacingOccurrences(of: "=", with: "")
                   .replacingOccurrences(of: "-", with: "")
                   .replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
                   .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Project builds successfully after changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ ISBN `=9780142437209` now correctly processes as `9780142437209`

## Impact
- **Immediate**: Resolves CSV import failures for Goodreads exports
- **Long-term**: Improves overall CSV import success rates
- **User Experience**: Eliminates need for manual ISBN cleanup in CSV files

## Prevention
Both CSVImportService and BookSearchService now have redundant sanitization to ensure robustness against various CSV formatting quirks.
