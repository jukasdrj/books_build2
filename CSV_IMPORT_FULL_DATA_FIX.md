# CSV Import Full Data Processing Fix

## Date: January 9, 2025

## Issue
The CSV import was only processing the first 5-10 rows (sample data) instead of all 795 rows in the CSV file.

## Root Cause
The `CSVImportSession` model only stored `sampleData` (first 5-10 rows for preview), and the import process was using this limited dataset instead of the full CSV data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended CSVImportSession Model
- Added `allData` property to store all CSV rows including header
- Kept `sampleData` for preview purposes

```swift
struct CSVImportSession {
    // ... other properties
    let sampleData: [[String]] // First 5-10 rows for preview
    let allData: [[String]] // All rows including header
}
```

### 2. Updated CSVParser
- Modified `parseCSV` to return both full data and sample data
- Updated `parseBooks` to use `allData` instead of `sampleData`

```swift
func parseBooks(from session: CSVImportSession, columnMappings: [String: BookField]) -> [ParsedBook] {
    // Use ALL data, not just sample data. Skip header row, start from index 1
    let dataRows = Array(session.allData.dropFirst())
    // Process all rows...
}
```

### 3. Navigation Enhancement
- Added `@AppStorage("selectedTab")` to CSVImportView
- When "View My Library" is clicked after successful import:
  - Sets `selectedTab = 0` to navigate to Library tab
  - Then dismisses the import sheet
- This ensures users are taken directly to their library to see imported books

## Files Modified
1. `/books/Models/ImportModels.swift` - Added `allData` property to CSVImportSession
2. `/books/Utilities/CSVParser.swift` - Updated to store and use full data
3. `/books/Services/CSVImportService.swift` - Fixed sample session creation
4. `/books/Views/Import/CSVImportView.swift` - Added tab navigation on completion

## Testing Results
- Build successful
- CSV import now processes all rows in the file
- Navigation to Library tab works correctly after import
- Sample/preview still shows limited rows as intended

## Impact
- Users can now import their entire Goodreads library (all 795+ books)
- Better user experience with direct navigation to library after import
- Preview functionality remains unchanged
