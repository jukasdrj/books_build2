## Implementation Notes

### What's Currently Working
1. **Search System**: Full provider routing with automatic fallbacks
2. **Import System**: Complete background processing with data validation
3. **Caching Layer**: Optimized CloudFlare proxy with hybrid caching
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
5. **Performance**: Concurrent processing with configurable batch sizes

### Key Implementation Details
- **Provider-Specific Routing**: BookSearchService supports `.auto`, `.isbndb`, `.google`, and `.openlibrary` providers
- **Enhanced Search Methods**: Multiple specialized search methods with fallback chains
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Custom relevance scoring, duplicate detection, and query optimization
- **Database Batching**: Efficient SwiftData batch operations with proper context management
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation service with real-time quality scoring
- **Background Processing**: Complete iOS background task integration with state persistence

### Architecture Strengths
- **Resilient**: Multiple fallback strategies prevent total failures
- **Performant**: Concurrent processing with smart batching where it matters
- **User-Friendly**: Background processing with progress tracking
- **Scalable**: Configurable performance profiles for different device capabilities

## Verification Status

- ‚úÖ All documentation updated to match current codebase (August 2025)
- ‚úÖ BookSearchService documentation reflects actual API methods and provider system
- ‚úÖ CSV Import System documentation updated with correct file paths and method signatures
- ‚úÖ CloudFlare proxy documentation verified against deployed implementation
- ‚úÖ Added detailed method signatures and enhanced feature descriptions
- ‚úÖ Clear distinction maintained between implemented and planned features

## Next Steps

For implementing the batch processing enhancement:
1. Verify ISBNdb plan supports batch APIs
2. Implement CloudFlare Workers batch endpoint
3. Update BookSearchService with batch methods
4. Test performance improvements vs current concurrent approach
