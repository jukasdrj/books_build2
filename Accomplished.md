### Overview
Implemented intelligent auto-dismiss functionality for wishlist additions in the SearchResultDetailView. When users add books to their wishlist (whether through text search or barcode scanning), the view now automatically dismisses after displaying a success toast, creating a streamlined and intuitive user experience.

### Key Activities
1. **Auto-Dismiss Logic**: Implemented smooth automatic view dismissal for wishlist additions
2. **Success Message Updates**: Enhanced messaging to indicate auto-dismiss behavior
3. **Timing Optimization**: Carefully tuned animation and dismiss timing for optimal UX
4. **Toolbar Logic Update**: Refined Done button visibility for different flows
5. **Barcode Integration**: Confirmed feature works seamlessly with barcode scanning

---

### IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

#### **Auto-Dismiss Functionality**
**Achievement**: Created intelligent auto-dismiss system for wishlist additions
**Files Modified**: `SearchResultDetailView.swift`
**Impact**:
- Eliminates unnecessary manual dismissal step for wishlist additions
- Maintains edit flow for library additions (no auto-dismiss)
- Works consistently across all search methods (text and barcode)
- Respects accessibility settings for animations

**Technical Implementation**:
```swift
// Wishlist branch (lines 240-252)
if toWishlist {
    HapticFeedbackManager.shared.lightImpact()
    successMessage = "üìö Added to your wishlist! Returning to search..."
    
    withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.6, dampingFraction: 0.8)) {
        showingSuccessToast = true
    }
    
    // Show toast for 1.5 seconds, then fade out and dismiss
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.5) {
        withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) {
            showingSuccessToast = false
        }
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
            dismiss()
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Success Message Enhancement**

#### **Timing Sequence Optimization**
**Achievement**: Carefully tuned timing for smooth, non-jarring user experience
**Implementation**:
1. **0.0s**: Success toast appears with spring animation
2. **1.5s**: Toast remains fully visible (reading time)
3. **1.5s-1.8s**: Toast fades out (0.3s animation)
4. **2.0s**: View dismisses automatically
5. **Total Duration**: ~2 seconds from action to dismiss

#### **Toolbar Done Button Logic**
**Achievement**: Refined Done button to only appear when needed
**Implementation**:
- Done button only shows for library additions (which open edit view)
- Hidden for wishlist additions (which auto-dismiss)
- Fixed operator precedence: `!(newlyAddedBook?.onWishlist ?? false)`

#### **Barcode Scanner Integration**
**Achievement**: Confirmed auto-dismiss works with barcode scanning flow
**Verification**:
- Barcode scan ‚Üí ISBN search ‚Üí Results list ‚Üí Same SearchResultDetailView
- Auto-dismiss applies equally to text search and barcode scan results
