### Key Activities
1.  **SwiftData Crash Resolution**: Diagnosed and fixed a "Mutating a managed object outside a write transaction" error that occurred when saving edits.
2.  **UI Correction**: Ensured the correct `EditBookView` is presented from the `BookDetailsView`, which also fixed the issue where API-provided fields were not correctly locked.
3.  **Preview Stability**: Resolved multiple build errors within the `#Preview` block for `EditBookView` by creating a dedicated preview wrapper to handle SwiftData model setup.
4.  **Field Lockdown Implementation**: Correctly implemented the UI to disable text fields for data fetched from the Google Books API and provided clear user guidance.

---

### Files Modified

#### `BookDetailsView.swift`
**Changes Made:**
-   Corrected the `.sheet` modifier to present the `EditBookView` instead of a non-existent `EnhancedEditBookView`.

**Why Changed:**
-   This was the root cause of the UI discrepancy where the field lockdowns were not appearing. The fix ensures the correct view is always used for editing, providing the intended user experience.

#### `EditBookView.swift`
**Changes Made:**
-   **Fixed SwiftData Crash**: Reworked the `saveAndDismiss` method to ensure that modifications to the `UserBook` and its related `BookMetadata` happen safely within SwiftData's automatic write transactions, eliminating the runtime crash.
-   **Correctly Disabled Fields**: Re-applied the `.disabled(true)` modifier to all text fields bound to data from the Google Books API and set their text color to `Color.theme.disabledText` for clear visual feedback.
-   **Resolved Preview Errors**: Created a new `EditBookViewPreviewWrapper` struct to properly initialize a `ModelContainer` and insert sample data for the `#Preview`. This resolved a series of `buildExpression` and "Cannot find in scope" errors that were preventing the preview from compiling.

**Why Changed:**
-   To create a stable and crash-free editing experience.
-   To protect the integrity of the data fetched from the Google Books API by preventing user edits.
-   To restore a working and reliable SwiftUI preview for faster UI development and iteration.
