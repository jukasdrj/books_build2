## TODAY'S SESSION: HIG-Compliance & Polish + Status Labels + Technical Debt Fixes

### Overview
Today's session was highly productive, focusing on three major areas: implementing comprehensive Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) compliance improvements, updating reading status labels to use book community abbreviations, and resolving critical technical debt issues. The session resulted in a production-ready app with enhanced accessibility, proper typography, security hardening, and resolved data migration issues.

### Key Activities
1. **HIG Compliance Implementation**: Comprehensive 3-phase accessibility and polish improvements
2. **Directory Organization**: Complete reorganization of project structure following iOS best practices
3. **Status Label Updates**: Changed to book community standard abbreviations (TBR, DNF)
4. **Migration Issue Resolution**: Fixed SwiftData decoding errors and data model inconsistencies
5. **Technical Debt Cleanup**: Resolved SF Symbol errors and documentation synchronization
