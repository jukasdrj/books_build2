## Navigation Architecture Fix & SearchResultDetailView Debugging Session - Current Date

### Overview
This session focused on resolving critical navigation issues that were causing SearchResultDetailView to briefly appear and then immediately dismiss. Through systematic debugging, we identified multiple root causes: mixed NavigationView/NavigationStack usage, nested navigation contexts from empty state actions, and missing service implementations. The session resulted in a robust, consistent navigation architecture across the entire app.

### Key Activities
1. **Navigation Architecture Audit**: Systematic review of all navigation patterns and contexts across the app
2. **SearchResultDetailView Debugging**: Deep investigation of the immediate dismiss issue when tapping search results
3. **Navigation Consistency Fix**: Standardized all views to use NavigationStack instead of mixed navigation approaches
4. **Empty State Navigation Fix**: Resolved nested navigation contexts caused by empty wishlist "Browse Books" action
5. **BookMetadata Hashable Implementation**: Added proper Hashable conformance for stable navigation destinations
6. **Documentation Synchronization**: Updated all documentation to reflect actual file structure and navigation patterns

---

### Root Causes Identified & Resolved

#### **1. Mixed Navigation Systems** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: StatsView was using NavigationView while ContentView used NavigationStack, creating navigation system conflicts.
**Solution**: Standardized all views to use NavigationStack, removed NavigationView from StatsView.
**Impact**: Eliminated navigation destination instability and immediate dismiss behavior.

#### **2. Nested Navigation Contexts** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: LibraryView empty state used NavigationLink(destination: SearchView()) creating nested SearchView on wishlist tab.
**Solution**: Replaced NavigationLink with programmatic tab switching via selectedTab binding.
**Impact**: Fixed the specific issue where search worked until user came from empty wishlist.

#### **3. Missing Hashable Conformance** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: BookMetadata lacked Hashable conformance, causing NavigationLink value-based navigation to be unstable.
**Solution**: Added proper Hashable implementation using unique googleBooksID for hash/equality.
**Impact**: Ensured stable navigation destination references.

#### **4. SwiftData Query in Navigation Destinations** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: SearchResultDetailView used @Query which can cause instability in navigation destination views.
**Solution**: Replaced @Query with direct modelContext.fetch() using FetchDescriptor.
**Impact**: Eliminated SwiftData-related navigation conflicts and view refresh issues.
