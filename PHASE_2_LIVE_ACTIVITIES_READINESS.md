       // Minimal, compact, and expanded layouts needed
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Points**
   ```swift
   // CSVImportService enhancement needed:
   func startImport(...) async {
       // Add: Start Live Activity
       await LiveActivityManager.shared.startImportActivity(...)
       
       // Existing import logic...
       
       // Add: Update Live Activity during progress
       await LiveActivityManager.shared.updateActivity(with: progress)
   }
   ```
